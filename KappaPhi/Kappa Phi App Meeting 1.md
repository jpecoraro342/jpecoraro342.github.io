# Kappa Phi App

- A Web Application (and/or iOS) will be made for Kappa Phi Members to help aid in logistical interactions among brothers including payments, etc.
- Joseph will donate (some) time for development of the application to help reduce (or eliminate) costs. Note: The more time spent developing the app, the less physical money Joseph donates to Kappa Phi.

### Process
- A Kappa Phi Representative will handle all (most) interactions with the developer(s).
- Detials will be presented to developer(s) in the form of prioritized User Stories.
- Developer(s) will develop the application in iterations, communicating with the Kappa Phi representative in the process.

### Current Work

- Ben will discuss with officers, and come up with a larger list of User Stories, which will be prioritized

### Other

- Ben will bring up to officers possibility of the constitutional amendment
	- "Alumni eligibility can not be lost"
	- This can currently occur in instances where...
		- a brother has gained eligibility by reaching the correct number of active semesters, but remained an active member instead of becoming an alumnus. In a later semester he has become inactive for various reasons, and therefore lost elgibility
		- a brother has been engaged, allowing him to be eligible for alumni status, but later the engagement was broken off, rendering him ineligible to become an alumni. 
		- etc.
