    <h2>Joseph Pecoraro - Software Engineer, iOS Developer</h2>
    <p>
        Hi there! My name is Joseph Pecoraro, and I'm currently finishing up my 4th year as a Computer Engineering student at the University of Florida. I specialize in native iOS development, and am currently available for hire. I also have some experience with game dev using Unity, and am hoping to publish some VR games to the app store soon. Starting in June, I will be working as a full time Software Engineer at Ultimate Software in Weston, Fl. 
    </p>

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <p> I hope to have all of my projects up soon, but for now this area of my website is under construction. In the mean time, here is my <a href="Resume.pdf" target="_blank">R&eacutesum&eacute</a> if you want to take a look. You can also find <em>some</em> of my projects on <a href="http://github.com/jpecoraro342">github</a>, and some more information about what I've worked on at my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseph-pecoraro-2ab0458a">linkedin</a>.</p>
